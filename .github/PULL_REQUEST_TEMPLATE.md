```
3.test_cases/
└── <framework>/                # e.g. pytorch, megatron, jax
    └── <library>/              # e.g. picotron, FSDP, megatron-lm
        └── <model>/            # e.g. SmolLM-1.7B (may be omitted for single-model cases)
            ├── Dockerfile      # Container / environment setup
            ├── README.md       # Overview, prerequisites, usage
            ├── slurm/          # Slurm-specific launch scripts
            ├── kubernetes/     # Kubernetes manifests
            └── hyperpod-eks/   # HyperPod EKS instructions
```

- Top-level files (`Dockerfile`, `README.md`, training scripts, configs) cover general setup.
- Subdirectories (`slurm/`, `kubernetes/`, `hyperpod-eks/`) contain service-specific launch instructions.
- Not all service subdirectories are required — include only the ones relevant to your test case.

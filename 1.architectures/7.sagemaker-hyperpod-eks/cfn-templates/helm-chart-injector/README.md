# Helm Chart Injector

The Helm Chart Injector is an AWS Lambda function that can be used as an [`AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudformation-customresource.html) to automatically install the required [Kubernetes packages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-eks-install-packages-using-helm-chart.html) for orchestrating HyperPod clusters with Amazon EKS.

The [Amazon SageMaker HyperPod EKS Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/2433d39e-ccfe-4c00-9d3d-9917b729258e/en-US) maintains a copy of the `layer.zip` and `function.zip` files used to instantiate the Helm Chart Injector in an AWS owned S3 bucket, as configured using the `CustomResourceS3Bucket`, `LayerS3Key`, and `FunctionS3Key` parameters in the [main-stack.yaml](./../nested-stacks/main-stack.yaml) template. However, you can follow the steps below to build your own copy of the dependency files and host them in your own S3 bucket. 

## How to Build the Helm Chart Injector to Host in Your Own S3 Bucket:
```bash 
## execute the main script
./deploy.sh 

## Set your S3 bucket name
BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket-name-here> 

## Sync function.zip and lambda-layer.zip with your S3 bucket
aws s3 sync ./outputs s3://$BUCKET_NAME --delete
```

After completing these steps, you can proceed to deploy the [helm-chart-stack.yaml](./../nested-stacks/helm-chart-stack.yaml) template by itself, or as part of the nested stack configuration in the [main-stack.yaml](./../nested-stacks/main-stack.yaml) template. See the main [README.md](./../README.md) for details. 

> **IMPORTANT**: Be sure to update the following parameters to reference your S3 Bucket and the artifacts you uploaded there:    
- `CustomResourceS3Bucket`
- `LayerS3Key`
- `FunctionS3Key`

## Cluster Deployment 

This section goes through all the steps necessary to deploy the architecture discussed in the previous section. Moreover, this section covers how to set up a [Data Repository Association (DRA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/create-dra-linked-data-repo.html) between the S3 bucket and FSx Lustre Filesystem. With DRA, user can access to the objects in Amazon S3 bucket through Lustre filesystem. **Make sure to check [prerequisites](https://github.com/aws-samples/awsome-distributed-training/tree/geniac/1.architectures/2.aws-parallelcluster#2-pre-requisites) before proceed.**

# ML Training Reference Architectures & Tests <!-- omit from toc -->

This repository contains reference architectures and test cases for distributed model training with [AWS ParallelCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/what-is-aws-parallelcluster.html), [AWS Batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/what-is-batch.html), and [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-console.html). The test cases cover different types and sizes of models as well as different frameworks and parallel optimizations (Pytorch DDP/FSDP, MegatronLM, NemoMegatron...).

The major components of this directory are:

```bash
reference-architectures/
|-- 1.architectures                # CloudFormation templates for reference arch
|-- 2.amazon_machine_images/       # Scripts to create AMIs
|-- 3.test_cases/                  # Reference test cases and/or benchmark scripts
|-- 4.validation_scripts/          # Tools to measure performance or troubleshoot
`-- ...
```

**NOTE**: the architectures are designed to work with the S3 bucket and VPC created using reference templates `1.architectures/0.s3/` and `1.architectures/1.vpc_network/`. _You're strongly recommended to deploy these two templates **before** deploying any of the reference architectures._

## 1. Architectures

Architectures are located in `1.architectures` and consists of utilities and service related architectures.

| Name                                                               | Category | Usage                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [`0.s3`](./1.architectures/0.s3)                                   | Storage  | Create an S3 bucket                                 |
| [`1.vpc_network`](./1.architectures/1.vpc_network)                 | Network  | Create a VPC with subnets required resources        |
| [`2.aws-parallelcluster`](./1.architectures/2.aws-parallelcluster) | Compute  | Cluster templates for GPU & custom silicon training |
| [`3.aws-batch`](./1.architectures/3.aws-batch)                     | Compute  | AWS Batch template for distributed training         |
| [`4.amazon-eks`](./1.architectures/4.amazon-eks)                   | Compute  | Manifest files to train with Amazon EKS             |
| [`5.sagemaker-hyperpod`](./1.architectures/5.sagemaker-hyperpod)   | Compute  | SageMaker HyperPod template for distributed training|

More will come, feel free to add new ones (EKS, Ray?). You will also find [documentation](./1.architectures/efa-cheatsheet.md) for EFA and the recommended environment variables.

## 2. Custom Amazon Machine Images

Custom machine images can be built using [Packer](www.packer.io) for AWS ParallelCluster, Amazon EKS and plain EC2. These images are based are on Ansible roles and playbooks.

## 3. Test cases: support matrix

All test cases are under `3.test_cases/`. You can go in each test case directory to learn how to run it.

## 4. Validation scripts

Utilities scripts and micro-benchmarks examples are set under `4.validation_scripts/`.

## 5. CI

Integration tests are written in [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org). Just run:
```
pytest .
```

Alternatively you can run tests with out capturing stdout and keeping all docker images an other artifacts.
```
pytest -s --keep-artifacts=t
```

## 6. Contributors

Thanks to all the contributors for building, reviewing and testing.

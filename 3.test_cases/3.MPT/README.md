# Mosaic Pretraind Transformers (MPT) Test Case <!-- omit in toc -->

MPT are GPT-style models in [llm-foundry](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry/tree/main) with some special features -- [Flash Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) for efficiency, [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409) for context length extrapolation, and stability improvements to mitigate loss spikes.

This project contains:

* AWS optimized [llm-foundry](https://github.com/mosaicml/llm-foundry/tree/main) container image.
* Slurm scripts for the [c4 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/c4) preparation and multi-node distributed training.

## 1. Preparation

This guide assumes that you have the following:

* A functional Slurm cluster on AWS.
* Docker, [Pyxis](https://github.com/NVIDIA/pyxis) and [Enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot) installed.
* An FSx for Lustre filesystem mounted on `/fsx`.

We recommend that you setup a Slurm cluster using the templates in the architectures [directory](../../1.architectures). Before creating the Slurm cluster, you need to setup the following environment variables:

```bash
export APPS_PATH=/apps
export ENROOT_IMAGE=$APPS_PATH/llm-foundry.sqsh
export FSX_PATH=/fsx
export DATA_PATH=$FSX_PATH/c4-dataset
export TEST_CASE_PATH=${HOME}/3.MPT  # where you copy the test case or set to your test case path
cd $TEST_CASE_PATH
```

then follow the detailed instructions [here](../../1.architectures/2.aws-parallelcluster/README.md).

## 2. Build the container

Before running training jobs, you need to use an [Enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot) container to retrieve and preprocess the input data. Below are the steps you need to follow:

1. Copy the test case files to your cluster. You will need `0.llm-foundry.Dockerfile`,
2. Build the Docker image with the command below in this directory.

   ```bash
   docker build -t llm-foundry -f 0.llm-foundry.Dockerfile .
   ```

3. Once the Docker image is built, you can check if it is present with `docker images`. You should see an output similar to this one:

   ```bash
   REPOSITORY         TAG                                  IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
   llm-foundry        latest                               a964fb32cd53   2 weeks ago   23.6GB
   ...
   ```

4. Convert the Docker image to a squash file with the command below.

   ```bash
   enroot import -o ${ENROOT_IMAGE} dockerd://llm-foundry:latest
   ```

   The file will be stored in the `/apps` directory (default). The output should look as below.

    ```bash
    [INFO] Fetching image

    36a8c752c28a2db543d2a632a3fc1fcbd5789a6f3d45b9d3a24632420dedcfa8

    [INFO] Extracting image content...
    [INFO] Creating squashfs filesystem...

    Parallel mksquashfs: Using 32 processors
    Creating 4.0 filesystem on /apps/llm-foundry.sqsh, block size 131072.
    [========================================================================================================================================================================================================================-] 291068/291068 100%

    Exportable Squashfs 4.0 filesystem, gzip compressed, data block size 131072
            uncompressed data, uncompressed metadata, uncompressed fragments, uncompressed xattrs
            duplicates are not removed
    ...
    ```

It will take around 5 minutes to convert the container image from Docker to the Enroot format. Once done proceed to the next stage.

For ease of testing we've included a `Makefile` that automatically builds and imports the latest image. To run this, execute `make` or you can individually specify `make build` to build the Docker image, `make clean` to remove the squash file and `make import` to import the Dockerfile into enroot squash file.

## 3. Run the processing job

You need to retrieve input data and preprocess it before running the training job.

1. Run a preprocessing job by submitting the script `1.c4-preprocess.sbatch` to Slurm. The command will return the Slurm Job ID. You can use `squeue` to consult the status of your jobs.

    ```bash
    sbatch 1.c4-preprocess.sbatch
    ```

    It will create the streaming dataset for composer library using C4 dataset in `/fsx/c4-dataset` (default).

2. You see a new file in your current working directory called `c4-preprocess_XY.out` where `XY` corresponds the Slurm job ID. This is your output file and will capture the `STDOUT` and `STDERR` from your job. You can check how it progresses via the command `tail -f c4-preprocess_XY.out` with the correct job ID instead of `XY`. If running successfully, the job will generate an output similar to the except below.

    ```console
    Downloading (…)okenizer_config.json: 100%|██████████| 156/156 [00:00<00:00, 1.09MB/s]
    ...
    Downloading metadata: 100%|██████████| 2.40M/2.40M [00:01<00:00, 2.05MB/s]
    ...
    train_small:  32%|███▏      | 31745/100000 [01:51<00:19, 3538.83it/s]
    ...
    val_small: 100%|██████████| 10000/10000 [00:19<00:00, 514.19it/s]
    ```

    Please be aware that this job downloads the tokenizer on demand (if it's not available under `./EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b`), after which the tokenizer will be cached under `$HOME/.cache/huggingface`, and the `$HOME` directory is an NFS filesystem shared by the head node. Please consult the [HuggingFace cache management](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/cache) document to learn more about fine-grained control of the HuggingFace cache.

3. After the job completed, check `/fsx/c4-dataset` (default) which will contain a structure similar as below

    ```console
    /fsx/c4-dataset/
    ├── train_small
    │   ├── index.json
    │   ├── shard.00000.mds
    │   ├── shard.00001.mds
    │   ├── shard.00002.mds
    ...
    │   ├── shard.00023.mds
    │   └── shard.00024.mds
    └── val_small
        ├── index.json
        ├── shard.00000.mds
        ├── shard.00001.mds
        └── shard.00002.mds
    ```

Once preprocessing is done, you will run a training job in the next stage.

## 4. Distributed training of MPT

Now that the data is preprocessed, we will pretrain a MPT model with [Mosaic Composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer).

1. Run a training job by submitting script `2.train-mpt-manual-distributed.sbatch` to Slurm via `sbatch` as shown below.

    ```bash
    sbatch 2.train-mpt-manual-distributed.sbatch
    ```
by default it runs `mpt-7b` model. You can specify model to be trained as:
    ```bash
    sbatch 2.train-mpt-manual-distributed.sbatch mpt-30b
    ```

2. When the training job completes successfully, it should produce a log output similar to the below in the `logs/` directory of `$TEST_CASE_PATH`.

```console
...
0: [batch=1/300000000]:
0:       Train time/epoch: 0
0:       Train time/batch: 0

```

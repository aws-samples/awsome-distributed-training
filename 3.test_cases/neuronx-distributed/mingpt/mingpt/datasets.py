    """
    Creates n-digit addition problems. For example, if n=2, then an example
    addition problem would be to add 85 + 50 = 135. This problem would be
    represented as the following string for the GPT:

    "8550531"

    This is because:
    - we are discarding the + and =, which are not necessary. We just encode the digits
      of the input numbers concatenated together.
    - the result 135 is encoded backwards to make the addition easier to learn for the
      GPT model, because of how the addition algorithm works.

    As one more example, the problem 6 + 39 = 45 would be encoded as:

    "0639054"

    where you will notice that we are padding with zeros to make sure that we always
    produce strings of the exact same size: n + n + (n + 1). When n=2, this is 7.
    At test time, we will feed in an addition problem by giving the first 2n digits,
    and hoping that the GPT model completes the sequence with the next (n+1) digits
    correctly.

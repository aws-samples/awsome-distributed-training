## 1. Preparation

The guide assumes that you have the following:

* A functional Slurm cluster on AWS, whose compute instances are based on DeepLearning AMI.
* An FSx for Lustre filesystem mounted on `/fsx`.
* `enroot` if you want to run the container example.

We recommend that you setup a Slurm cluster using the templates in the architectures [directory](../../1.architectures). 


## 2. Submit training job using conda environment on Slurm

In this step, you will create PyTorch virtual environment using conda.
This method is only available on Slurm because it runs the training job without
using a container.

```bash
bash 0.create-conda-env.sh
```

It will prepare `miniconda3` and `pt_cpu` `pt_cpu` includes `torchrun` 


Submit DDP training job with:

```bash
sbatch 1.conda-train.sbatch
```

Output of the training job can be found in `logs` directory:

```bash
# cat logs/cpu-ddp-conda_xxx.out

## 3. Submit training job using Docker container

In this example, you'll learn how to use the official PyTorch Docker image 
and execute the container within the Slurm scheduler using Enroot or EKS using
kubeflow training operator. 


[Enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot) uses the same underlying technologies 
as containers but removes much of the isolation they inherently provide 
while preserving filesystem separation. This approach is generally preferred 
in high-performance environments or virtualized environments where portability 
and reproducibility is important, but extra isolation is not warranted.

Create Enroot container images:

```bash
bash 2.create-enroot-image.sh
```

It will pull `pytorch/pytorch` container, then create [squashfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/squashfs.txt) image named `pytorch.sqsh`.

Submit DDP training job using the image with:

```bash
sbatch 4.container-train.sbatch
```

Output of the training job can be found in `logs` directory:

```bash
# cat logs/cpu-ddp-container.out
